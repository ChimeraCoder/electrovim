Electrovim adds Vim keybindings to Firefox. It supports multiprocess mode (also known as [electrolysis](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis) or e10s). 


### Installation

Electrovim can be installed from the [Firefox Add-ons marketplace](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/electrovim/).

Upon installation, Electrovim will be available from any new tabs opened. Tabs that were open when Electrovim were installed for the first time may need to be refreshed.


### Usage

The current mode (normal or insert) is shown on the bottom right of the window. Clicking inside any input field will automatically enter insert mode. You can leave insert mode by pressing Escape, just like in Vim.


When in normal mode, use `d` to close the current tab. `CTRL+n` and `CTRL+p` switch to the next and previous tab, respectively. `CTRL+f` and `CTRL+b` are the equivalent of page up/page down.


Command       | Action
------------- | -------------
d | Closes tab
j | Scroll down
k | Scroll up
/ | Enter find mode
H | Go back in browser history
L | Go forward in browser history
gg | Scroll to top of page
G | Scroll to bottom of page
CTRL + b | Page up
CTRL + f | Page down
CTRL + n | Switch to the next tab
CTRL + p | Switch to the previous tab


#### Find mode

Press `/` to enter find mode and begin typing text to search the current page. Electrovim automatically highlights the first match (if any). To find subsequent matches, press `Enter` to complete the search and press `n` to iterate through all matches.
